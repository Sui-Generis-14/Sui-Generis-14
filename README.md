##  ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Sneha Uppu
I'm a Computer Science graduate student at The George Washington University with a strong focus on **Data Analytics, Data Science,** and **AI-driven solutions**. I love transforming complex data into actionable insights and building intelligent systems that not only solve real-world problems but also create positive social impact. From developing ML models to exploring generative AI and cloud-based solutions, I enjoy pushing boundaries, learning every step of the way, and applying data in ways that drive meaningful change.
