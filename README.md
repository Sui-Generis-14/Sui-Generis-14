##  👋 Hi! I'm Sneha Uppu
I'm a Computer Science graduate student at The George Washington University with a strong focus on **Data Analytics, Data Science,** and **AI-driven solutions**. I love transforming complex data into actionable insights and building intelligent systems that not only solve real-world problems but also create positive social impact. From developing ML models to exploring generative AI and cloud-based solutions, I enjoy pushing boundaries, learning every step of the way, and applying data in ways that drive meaningful change. 

## 🎓 Education
**Master of Science in Computer Science**, *The George Washington University* (Expected: May 2026)
- GPA: 3.66 
- Honors: SEAS Merit Award
- Coursework: Neural Networks & Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Database Systems II, Cloud Computing

**Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Systems Engineering**, *Andhra University College of Engineering for Women* (Graduated: Apr 2024)
- CGPA: 8.46

## 💼 Experience

**Data Support Assistant**, *GWU Libraries* (Jan 2025 – Present) <br>
At GWU Libraries, I analyzed borrowing and circulation data to surface student demand, guiding acquisitions and partner sourcing. I processed nearly 50,000 rows of e-resource usage in Excel (filters, aggregations, lookups) to highlight trends, and structured/validated transaction logs to improve accuracy on overdues, fines, and availability. I also improved dataset organization for researchers and helped design a systematic collection-maintenance approach based on usage histories.

**CRM Data & Analytics Intern**, *PricewaterhouseCoopers(PwC - AC)* (Feb 2024 – Aug 2024) <br>
At PwC, I extracted, cleaned, and organized 10,000+ Salesforce CRM records to improve the accuracy of client and sales reporting. I built and optimized interactive dashboards tracking lead conversion, pipeline progression, and customer engagement, giving stakeholders clear, real-time insights. I also coordinated cross-functional work in Jira to streamline workflows and authored 20+ pages of QA documentation (test cases, validation steps) to standardize and strengthen reporting processes.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

**Similar Image Finder** <br>
Team project: we embedded 21k+ Unsplash photos with CLIP ViT-B/32, then used KNN (cosine) to return the top-6 nearest images for any query; evaluated on 1,000 queries with ~0.91 average similarity. Implemented in PyTorch + scikit-learn with Matplotlib visualizations. It’s useful for visual search, content discovery, deduplication, and mood-board building.

**MATLAB Image Processing** <br>
Built from personal interest (not a group project): I created a lightweight MATLAB pipeline to clean and analyze images end-to-end—preprocessing (resize/denoise, RGB→Lab), segmentation (Otsu + morphological ops), feature extraction (color/texture), and simple classifiers (KNN/SVM) to label regions and compute counts/areas. It’s useful when you need quick, explainable measurements—e.g., tracking color changes, counting objects, or flagging anomalies—without heavy deep-learning infrastructure.
